Contao News Categories Search
=====================

Contao extension to allow search results of the front end search module to be filtered 
by news categories. It adds two additional settings to Contao's regular front end 
search module: one to enable filtering and one to restrict filtering to certain 
categories.

Once filtering is enabled, the search module will additionally show checkboxes 
for each category, whith the user can then select.

_Note:_ after installing this extension, you need to re-index the search index.
